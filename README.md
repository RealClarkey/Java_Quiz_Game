# Trivial Pursuit-Inspired Java Quiz Game

This project is a modified version of *Trivial Pursuit*, developed as a university coursework assignment. It showcases principles of object-oriented programming, unit testing, GUI development, and integration with both CSV files and MySQL databases.

##  Game Overview

- Roll a dice to randomly select one of six quiz categories.
- Answer a question from that category.
- Continue rolling and answering until you either reach a specified number of correct answers or lose all your lives.
- Questions are loaded from CSV files or a MySQL database and are not repeated within the same game.

##  Features

###  Core Functionality
- Object-Oriented Design following SOLID principles.
- Read/write/delete questions using both CSV files and MySQL.
- Customisable number of questions and lives.
- Fully unit-tested using JUnit.

###  Graphical User Interface
- Java Swing GUI with menus for both players and admins.
- Visual feedback for dice rolls, score, and game status.
- **Custom Board Feature**: A circular board UI with a player icon that moves based on dice rolls.

###  Circular Board Movement
The GUI includes a visually engaging circular game board with 24 unique positions. Each time the player rolls the dice, their icon moves to the next position on the board, creating the effect of rotating around a circular path.

The playerâ€™s position is updated using pre-defined (x, y) coordinates that follow a smooth, circular layout. This adds a dynamic and interactive board-game feel to the quiz experience

###  Admin Tools
- Add single or multiple questions to specific CSVs or MySQL tables.
- Remove questions by row ID.
- GUI buttons and input fields to manage all quiz content visually.

###  High Score Table
- View, sort, and reset high scores.
- Supports both CSV and MySQL storage.

| File/Class             | Purpose                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Read.java`            | Reads from CSV files                         |
| `Write.java`           | Writes to CSV files                          |
| `Delete.java`          | Deletes from CSV files                       |
| `DBConnector.java`     | Manages MySQL connections                    |
| `DBCredentials.java`   | Stores protected DB credentials              |
| `GameFunctions.java`   | Core game logic (dice roll, check answer...) |
| `GameSetup.java`       | Runs the game loop                           |
| `Gui.java`             | Main Swing GUI interface                     |
| `BoardPositions.java`  | Handles circular player movement             |

##  Testing

Each method includes at least 2 unit tests. Tests cover:
- CSV loading and data validation
- Adding/removing questions
- Game logic (dice rolls, answer checking)
- GUI actions and database calls

##  Requirements

- Java 11+
- XAMPP (for local MySQL testing)
- JUnit 5 (for testing)

##  How to Run

### CLI Version
1. Compile and run `Main.java`
2. Follow the prompts to set up the game and play via terminal.

### GUI Version
1. Run `Gui.java`
2. Enter player name, then select "Play Game" or "Admin" mode
3. Use the graphical interface to play or manage questions

>  If using MySQL, make sure your XAMPP server is running and the credentials in `DBCredentials.java` are correct.
